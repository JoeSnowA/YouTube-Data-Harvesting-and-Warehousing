PROBLEM STATEMENT:
	
 	We have to create an application using stream lit, so that any user can access our application and fetch data’s from any YouTube channels. 
	Extracting data’s from YouTube API and storing it into MongoDB and then transforming into MYSQL to get data’s of any channels.   

OVERVIEW:
	
 	Our view is to create a user-friendly application using stream lit and extracting data’s from Google API and fetching all data’s into MongoDB and transforming into MYSQL. 
  	At last we’ll provide data’s to users in table format for them to understand easily.

WORKFLOW:
	
 	Create a Google account and connect it to YouTube API to extract data’s. Create an API-key to extract data’s like channels, videos, comments from any YouTube channels.  With a click of button in stream lit using stream lit API store the extracted data’s into MongoDB Lake. By converting unstructured data’s into Data Frame and migrating it to MYSQL. Using queries on MYSQL we fetch data’s by given user input and present them into table format using Stream lit application.
